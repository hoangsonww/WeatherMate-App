Before you begin, please ensure you have a GitHub account and have familiarized yourself with the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). This will involve creating a branch, making changes, submitting a pull request, and reviewing and discussing these changes.

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. To report a bug, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.
2. If the issue is unreported, **open a new issue**. Provide a **clear title and description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for StickyNotes App, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the enhancement has already been suggested.
2. If it hasn't, **open a new issue**. Provide a **clear title and description**, as detailed as possible and if possible, include **examples** of how the enhancement would work.

### Your First Code Contribution
